					<p>You may use either of the following two methods to submit a report:</p>
					<h3>Online</h3>
					<button>Make a Report Online</button></li>
					<h3>By Phone</h3>
					<p>Dial toll-free, within the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico and Canada: <strong class="nowrap">XXX-XXX-XXXX</strong></p>
